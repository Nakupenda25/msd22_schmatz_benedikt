# Good style

## How to write good commit messages

- Write in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug"
- Limit the header to 50 characters
- Capitalize the header
- Do not end the header with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## How to write good code comments

- Good comments don't repeat the code
- They provide context and explain why
- They are not a substitute for good code
- Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it
- Provide links to copies of code that was used
