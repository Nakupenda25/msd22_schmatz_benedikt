<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a simple file about my two cats, Moha and Chili. It contains
no instructions, only some information about both of them.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-they">Who are they?</h2>
<p>Chili is a female brown tabby cat, that loves to cause all kinds of
mischief, including but not limited to: - Stealing food - Knocking
things over - Biting toes whenever possible</p>
<p>Moha is her brother, and usually the quieter one of the two. Although
he is bigger in size, he is a lot more timid than his sister. He loves
to sleep, especially in the basket on the cat tree.</p>
<p>They are both very adorable, and I am glad they are in my life. And
even though they are a lot of work, I wouldn’t trade them for
anything.</p>

<p>I’m glad you asked! Here is a picture of them!</p>

<p>There is not much that needs to be said, but if you want to know more
about them, don’t hesitate to ask me! I am also happy to provide more
pictures upon request.</p>
