# Git Exercise

## What is this for?

This is a simple exercise to get familiar with git and GitHub. It's part of the "Konfigurationsmanagement" course at FH JOANNEUM.

## Where should I look?

Check out the [exercise2.md](exercise2.md) file for the actual exercise. It contains a short introduction to git, and a list of commands that are useful for using git.

Additionally, you can check out the [exercise1.md](exercise1.md) file, which contains a short introduction to Markdown, and a list of commands that are useful for using Markdown.

[exercise3.md](exercise3.md) contains a short introduction to Maven, and some screenshots of the exercise.

## Further information

There isn't really anything to add, I think the project is pretty self-explanatory.
