# Konfigurationsmanagement

## What is this for?

This is the main Repository for the course "Konfigurationsmanagement" at FH Joanneum Graz. It contains all the exercises we did in the course. Additionally, I will update the ReadMe file with information about the current exercise.

## What's going on right now?

You can check out the current exercise [here](exercise4.md). It is all about testing with JUnit. We were tasked to create a simple program and write some tests for it. Pretty useful stuff!

## Further information

There isn't really anything to add, I think the project is pretty self-explanatory.
