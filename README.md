# Calculating Game

## What is this for?

The Calculating game is a simple game that has the user calculate 7 randomized calculations. Only simple calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) will be asked of the player. At the end of the game, a summary is printed to the console, which includes:
- The calculation + the users input
- Whether the calculation was correct or not
- The time needed

## How do I install it?

1. Install a JDK, this program was made using JDK19, but everything after Java 11 should work just fine.\
To install Java on your computer, click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)!
2. Open your command-line and locate the project folder. Open "src", and you should see 3 seperate .java files
3. Once you are in the correct folder, type in `javac Application.java` to compile it. *
4. After you compiled the program, type `java Application` to run the program!
5. Have fun!

*this must only be done once

## What do I do next?

The program should start by giving you your first calculation. 
Type in your answer (rounded to two decimal points, if necessary) and press enter. 
The program should now give you your next calculation, until all 7 have been answered.

## Further information

"Calculating Game" was done as a programming project for university, so expect some janky code here and there.

This project is considered "complete", but if you feel inclined to modify it or add features, you are welcome to do so! Just make sure to credit me somewhere.
