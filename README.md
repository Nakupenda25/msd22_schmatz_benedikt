# Konfigurationsmanagement

## What is this for?

This is the main Repository for the course "Konfigurationsmanagement" at FH Joanneum Graz. It contains all the exercises we did in the course. Additionally, I will update the ReadMe file with information about the current exercise.

## What's going on right now?

Currently, we are working on exercise 6. This exercise is about documentation. We are learning how to use Javadoc to document our code. We are also learning how to use Maven to generate a site for our project.
