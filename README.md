# Konfigurationsmanagement

## What is this for?

This is the main Repository for the course "Konfigurationsmanagement" at FH Joanneum Graz. It contains all the exercises we did in the course. Additionally, I will update the ReadMe file with information about the current exercise.

## What's going on right now?

You can check out the current exercise [here](exercise5.md). It's about logging with Log4j2. We learned how to configure it and how to use it in our code.
We also did all this with git branches, so we could be prepared for real-life scenarios. Nice.

## Further information

In order to run some programs, you should incorporate some templates. You can find them [here](src/main/resources).
Currently only log4j2 needs to be configured, but there might be more in the future.
