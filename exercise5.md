# Exercise 5 - Branching and logging

## What is this for?

This is an exercise designed to teach us how to use git branches and logging with Log4j2. We learned how to configure it and how to use it in our code.
This has all been done on a test-branch and then merged into the main branch.

## Why are logging libraries useful?

Logging libraries are useful because they allow us to log information about our program. This can be useful for debugging, or for keeping track of what the program is doing.
This can be especially useful in large programs, where it is hard to keep track of everything that is happening.

## What logging levels are there in log4j?

There are 8 different logging levels in log4j. They are, in order of importance: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF.

The levels are used to determine what information is logged. For example, if the level is set to INFO, only INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages will be logged.

This is so that the user can decide what information they want to see. For example, if they are only interested in errors, they can set the level to ERROR.

## What configuration options are there for log4j?

There are many configuration options for log4j. For example, you can set the logging level, the output format, the output location, and much more.

For example, in this exercise the config-file is used to determine the output format/location of the log messages.
