# Exercise 6 - Documentation

## What is this for?

This is an exercise designed to teach us how to use Javadoc to document our code. We learned how to use it to generate documentation for our code.

## Most important aspects of documentation

- pom.xml
   - This file is used to configure the project. It is used to determine what dependencies the project has, and what plugins are used.
- Javadoc documentation
   - This is the documentation that is generated by Javadoc. This includes documentation for the classes, methods, etc.
- site.xml
    - This file is used to configure the site generation. It is used to determine what files are included in the site, and what the site looks like.
